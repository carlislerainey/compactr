Description: Creates empty plots with compact axis notation to which users can
    add whatever they like (points, lines, text, etc.) The notation is more
    compact in the sense that the axis-labels and tick-labels are closer to the
    axis and the tick-marks are shorter. Also, if the plot appears as part of a
    matrix, the x-axis notation is suppressed unless the plot appears along the
    bottom row and the y-axis notation is suppress unless the plot appears
    along the left column.
